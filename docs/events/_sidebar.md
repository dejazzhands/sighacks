<!-- Hello to anyone looking at this!
    If you're here to add another event to the sidebar, simply add it as such:
    [Event Name](path/to/documention/from/root)
    If reoccuring or better identifying, please denote the year of the event.
    FOR EXAMPLE:
    HackMIT 2024 is preferred over simply "HackMIT number whatever" or the events official subtitle. That is for the article, not the side bar :) 

    For file names, you can just put the last two years at the end. Unless this is maintained and used into the next century, its not important to differentiate that much.
    Please be considerate of future maintainers and users.
