# Getting Started

So you want to start building stuff. on your computer. with code.

You took a few classes. Maybe a bootcamp or two. But you couldn't come up with what to build, or realize your ideas.

But sometimes you just have to start building something. Anything. And there's no better way to build than with people in the same boat. 

Why hackathons? They force you to come up with a minimum viable product in a week, maybe even a day. You don't have to know everything, just a concrete idea of what you want to achieve.
